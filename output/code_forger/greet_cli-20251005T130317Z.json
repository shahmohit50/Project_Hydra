  "output": "Creating a simple Python project with the name `cli_hello` as a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that prints \"Hello, World!\" follows these steps:\n\n1. First, create a new directory for your project:\n```bash\n$ mkdir cli_hello\n$ cd cli_hello\n```\n\n2. Inside the `cli_hello` directory, create a file named `__init__.py`. This file tells Python that this directory should be considered a package:\n\n```bash\n$ touch __init__.py\n```\n\n3. Now create a new file inside the project directory called `main.py`. This will be the entry point of our application:\n\n```bash\n$ touch main.py\n```\n\n4. Open the `main.py` file in your favorite text editor and write the following code:\n\n```python\n# main.py\ndef print_hello():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_hello()\n```\n\n5. Create a new directory named `bin`. This is where we'll put our script for running the application from the command line:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir bin\n```\n\n6. Inside the `bin` directory, create a file called `cli_hello` (without extension). Write a simple script to run the `main.py`:\n\n```bash\n# In bin/cli_hello\nimport sys\nsys.argv.append(\".\")\nsys.execve(\"python\", sys.argv)\n```\n\n7. Now you need a setup file named `setup.py` for distributing the package. This file is not needed if you're only using this project locally but it helps keep the structure consistent:\n\n```bash\n$ touch setup.py\n```\n\nThe content of the `setup.py` should look like this:\n\n```python\n# setup.py\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nPACKAGE = \"cli_hello\"\nENTRY_POINT = {\n    'console_scripts': [\n        f'{PACKAGE} = {PACKAGE}.bin.cli_hello:main',\n    ]\n}\n\nsetup(name=PACKAGE,\n      version=\"0.1.0\",\n      description=\"A simple CLI application that prints Hello, World!\",\n      packages=find_packages(),\n      entry_points=ENTRY_POINT)\n```\n\n8. Finally, add a `README.md` file to explain your project and its usage:\n\n```bash\n$ touch README.md\n```\n\nNow you have the basic structure of your CLI project called `cli_hello`. To run the application from the terminal, type the following command inside the project directory:\n\n```bash\n$ ./bin/cli_hello\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nHello, World!\n```",
